Electronic circuits work a thousand times more rapidly than nerve cells in the human brain.
A problem that takes the human brain 2 years in order to solve it can be solved by a computer in one minute.
The heart of the electronic computer is its transistors.
In order to work a computer must have instructions; this is called “programming”.
There are two main types of electronic computers: analogue and digital.
In analogue computers problems are solved by analogy, the problems which analogue computers can solve are the following:
mechanical forces, speeds, rotations, etc.
Analogue computers are used for investigation of mechanical processes, in general,
they are used for scientific and engineering problems in which great accuracy is not required
but answers accurate enough are required quickly.
In digital computers problems are solved by counting. They may be very large and powerful.
All the data connected with the problem which must be solved are converted into electrical pulses
by very fast electronic switches and these pulses are stored and counted.
With modern electronic devices a single switching operation can take place
in a few nanoseconds (a nanosecond is a thousand – millionth of a second).
